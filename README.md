# 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis   
 
## 📌 Introduction    
 
**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is one of the most exciting fields in data science today. Among its many applications, **sentiment analysis** plays a key role in understanding public opinion, customer feedback, and brand perception.

In this project, we perform **sentiment analysis on tweets** to classify them as **positive, negative, or neutral**. Whether it's for opinion polling, brand monitoring, or developing marketing strategies — sentiment analysis is a powerful tool every data scientist should master.

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze tweets using NLP techniques and machine learning models to:
- Understand the **underlying sentiment** of text data
- **Classify tweets** based on polarity (Positive, Negative, Neutral)  
- Visualize and interpret results using various plots and metrics
